Reduced anticipation of negative events and occurrences. Obsessive compulsive rituals reduced. Answer the phone with more ease and less concerned about making mistakes in front of people.

On my second month, I became depressed and began to have anxiety attacks for just about everything. When my boyfriend and I would have relations he would tell me I was shedding more hair than normal. I paid more attention to it and my scalp began to hurt as if I had my hair in a ponytail and just took it out. Every time I&#039;d shower or brush my hair chunks would come out, by the third month I had lost about 30% of my hair and had noticeable bald spots. Not a pleasant experience.
